f you want to use this plugin with a free RPG Maker game, you can do it for free and there's no need to contact me. I only ask you to give credit to "Shora" or "Shora Lighting Plugin" somewhere in your game.

This plugin is NOT FREE for COMMERCIAL use. If you want to use it on a commercial title (any game that you may sell), you must pay a one-time $24.99 USD fee (via PayPal only: kieudung.c11212@gmail.com - please send me an e-mail/DMs). This license covers commercial use for your current and future projects, and it allows you to use all my plugins.
If you are the owner of the games, you can freely use it after buying the license. However if you just participate in the production of the game, not fully owning the game, you must contact me for authorization. This is to limit those from one person buying the license and fake-participate in many others game of other developers to avoid license problem.
Please note that this plugin is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind. You are responsible for testing it and checking if it’s compatible with your game. In no event shall the author of this plugin be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.
